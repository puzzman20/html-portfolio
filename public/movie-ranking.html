<h1>Mike's Favorite Movies (That he can think of at the moment)</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Animal House</h3>
<p>This comedy established much of my sense of humor.</p>
<h3>Kill Bill</h3>
<p>It adapts a comic book to screen better than any other graphic novel adaptation.</p>
<h3>The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai</h3>
<p>It's a sci-fi cult classic that's a little hard to explain.</p>
